# Advent of Code 2023 (Rust)

## Important Notice

**I am new to Rust**, although I have minimal prior experience working in Rust and quite a lot of experience with other more high-level languages, I am still learning the language and its idioms. I try my best to follow the norms and idioms of the language that I know of, but it is not perfect. If you see something that is not idiomatic, please let me know, but please be kind about it. I am still learning.

## About

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges. I am using this as a way to learn Rust, so I am trying to do everything myself, without using any external crates and without [Github Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/).

## Want to copy?

First of all, I would like to say that I do not recommend copying my solutions. I am doing this as a way to learn Rust, and I am not an expert in Rust. I am sure there are better ways to do things, and I am sure there are better ways to solve the problems. I am also sure that there are better ways to structure the code. I am not an expert in Rust, and I am not an expert in solving these kinds of problems. I am just doing this as a way to learn Rust. **The code is free to use, but I do not recommend copying it.**
